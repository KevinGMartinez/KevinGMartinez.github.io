	<P> AUTHOR NOTES
For those who don't normally like white chocolate - seriously: try it as cocoa. It's the perfect way to enjoy the incredible creaminess that white chocolate has. Make sure to use a good quality one - and if you're feeling naughty add just a liiiiiiitle bit of cream. Finished with a hint of grated nutmeg is my favorite way to drink it. â€”Erin McDowell </P>
