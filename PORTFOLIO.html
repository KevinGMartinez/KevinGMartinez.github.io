   Welcome to my porfolio page. Here you'll find some of my best work, at least, the ones that I am very proud of.
    While you're here, I figure I'd give you my top five favorite Glossier products that I just adore along why I think you'll love them too.Happy shopping!

      <li> <i> Glossier Solution </i> I love this bad boy very much. It takes the cake as my number one favorite. Although this product has mixed reviews,
      I adore it. Given that it is a chemical solution, it definetly exfoiliates your skin by giving you little tingles, ones that don't hurt I promise! After two 
      weeks of using it, I can tell you that I simply adore it!
