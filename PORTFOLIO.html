   Welcome to my porfolio page. Here you'll find some of my best work, at least, the ones that I am very proud of.
   While you're here, I figure I'd lay the Kevin Martinez Manifesto for you. What do I mean by this? I mean these are my top five rules
   and moral guidelines which I have always and will continue to follow for the rest of my life. So if you see me in the street, most likely in Bushwick, don't ask
   me to break these rules. You'll just be dissapointed.

      <li> <i> <u> Everyone Has A Right To Their Own Opinions: Just Don't Be A Jerk About It </i> </u>
        
     Growing up, I've had the amazing opportunity of meeting new people.
     Some came from the same town, others came from different cities, and even different parts of the world! With that being said, everyone has different viewpoints
     on different topics. That's why, on my site, I solemly swear to respect other's opinions as long as you respect mine. We can totally chill if you love pickles and I don't,
     I'll totally give you mine whenever the Mcdonald's lady put them on my big mac when I asked for none. We can totally go shopping if you like Urban Outfitters and I like
     thrifiting better. As long as you don't invalidate my opinion, and I don't invalidate yours, we can totally chill.

      <li> <i> <u> In This House, We Use Proper Pronouns</i> </u>
          <br>
       
      This is something that is extremely important to me. When I first got to New York, I'll be honest. I was ignorant. Not intentional of course, but nonetheless ignorant.
      I didn't know that gender was more than the binary, and it took some great people to show me how fluid and how beautiful the full gender spectrum can be. I think this
      something many people should take into account, whether it be for platonic, professional and even intimate relationships. Respect others by using proper pronouns. I know 
      sometimes it may feel confusing and the occassional slip up happens, after all we are human. It's definetly important to own up to your mistakes, apologize, and move on.
      Here, we're all about getting along and making sure everyone, and I mean, EVERYONE is welcome here.

      <li> <i> <u> Consent. Consent. And Consent. </i> </u>
        <br>
      Consent is a huge deal. I am a firm believer in the golden philosophy of no meaning no. Consent doesn't have to necessarily mean sexual consent but rather consent as a whole.
      If you don't want something done to you or for you, you have every right to say no. Don't be afraid to stick up for yourself. If someone chooses not to respect your boundaries,
      then they're not worth your time or precious energy. Repeat after me, NO MEANS NO. Say that a couple times and you'll be feeling confident enough to stick up for yourself in no
      time.
