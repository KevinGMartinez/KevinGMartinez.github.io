	<P> WELCOME TO MY PAGE! YOU'VE MADE IT TO THIS POINT SO I FIGURE NOW IS AS GOOD OF A TIME AS ANY TO GIVE YOU THE 411 ON WHO I AM AND WHAT I DO. MY NAME IS KEVIN, IM 19 AND IM LITERALLY MADE UP OF 30% CHICKEN NUGGETS, 30% MANGO BALM DOT COM AND 40% FLAMING HOT CHEETOS. I KNOW, PRETTY ODD HUH?</P>

	<p> ASIDE FROM THAT, I WRITE. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW. EVERYONE'S A WRITER THESE DAYS BUT IM TELLING YOU, I AM A WRITER. I ALSO LOVE ART, DID I FORGET TO MENTION THAT? SO ART IS KIND OF MY THING IN A WAY. I CAN'T DRAW OR SEW TO SAVE A LIFE BUT I CAN DEFINETLY APPRECIATE A GOOD WORK OF ART WHEN I SEE IT. I MEAN IT, ASK ME WHO MY FAVORITE ARTIST IS AND I'LL TELL YOU. CINDY SHERMAN, I'M LOOKING RIGHT AT YOU.</p>

	<p>ASIDE FROM ART AND WRITING, I LOVE TO CHILL OUT WITH MY CUTE GERMAN SHEPHERD, WATCH SOME CRAPPY HBO SHOW, EAT SOME MCDONALD'S $3 BUNDLE DEAL, AND WRITE. THROW IN A GLASS OF MERLOT AND WE MIGHT JUST HAVE TO GET MARRIED. ANYWAYS, I KNOW THIS MAY HAVE TO BE PROFESSIONAL AND ALL, SINCE HEY ITS 2019 AND THE ECONOMY SUCKS AND JOBS AREN'T EASY THESE DAYS BUT WHAT'S NOT SOME FUN IN THIS HECTIC WORLD. I'M JUST TRYING TO WORK HARD, HAVE SOME FUN, IF THAT EXISTS, AND BE AS MERRY AS CAN BE.</p>

<p>THANKS FOR CHECKING THIS OUT. YOU'RE A REAL ONE. IF YOU EVER SEE ME ON THE STREET, ESPECIALLY IN GOOD OLD BUSHWICK, SAY HI. OR JUST COMPLIMENT MY SHOES. I'LL KNOW WHO YOU ARE. I GOTCHU, AFTER ALL I THINK WE'RE ALL FRIENDS. DON'T YOU? Also, while you're here, go check out my portfolio/one of my favorite works down below! Enjoy xx</P>
